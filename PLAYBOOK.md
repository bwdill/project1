## My experience with this project

Fill in here a brief summary of your experience with the project. What did you
learn?

#### This was a fun and interesting introduction to server coding. I found it pretty simple to do
#### in java. I found researching how to use and implement sockets in java to be interesting and
#### surprisingly simple to do. It took me a minute to figure out how to use the input and output streams
#### but overall wasn't hard to figure out. I havn't read ahead to the next project but learning about
#### making the server accessable from other devices would be cool to learn.
